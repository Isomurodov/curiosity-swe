DTM - Group Project for Software Engineering

A search-based website to leverage podcasts as a form of media to promote curiosity and stimulate interest in various topics. It is a full-stack pet project with an AI element at its core.

The software analyzes the text prompt you provide. It involves using text analysis and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand the user's input and then searching for and retrieving relevant video segments based on that input. The central part of the software dealing with topic modelling has been implemented using gensim library.

The backend has been written in Flask and the frontend in CSS and HTML.

Currently, I am learning the deployment aspects of the project.
